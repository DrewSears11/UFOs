# UFOs
Module 11

1. Overview of Project: The purpose of this project was to create a webpage where UFO enthusiasts can easily idenitfy 
UFO sitings using a search feature on a HTML page.

2. Results: By scrolling to the bottom of the webpage you are able to search by 5 different variables.  You can find 
results of the date it was sited, city, state, country and even shape of the UFO by entering which variable you would like
to search in results page.  I tested to see if Richmond, VA has been a hot spot for UFOs and you can see it is not.  Nothing populate for the city.  In fact, as you can see below, Virginia itself only had one UFO siting.

3. Summary:  One drawback of the webpage is that you cannot save your search results.  A couple recomendations I would have to enhance this would be to add a function and button click that would let you export your search to a .csv file.  A second reccomendation would be to add a button that displays when no results are found.  For now, it just displays no results so it could confuse the user.
